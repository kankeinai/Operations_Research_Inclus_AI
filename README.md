# Operations Research Inclus AI

This github repository was created to store the source code related to the project. Link to the project itself would be published later (after approval).


The project topic was suggested by Inclus.
The main idea is to suggest the ways how the genrative AI namely Large Language models can be utilized in the risk analysis. The used model is ChatGpt-4.

The repository contains 4 files:
* Summary_formulation_demo.ipynb – the first approach in summarization of risks of given company based on comments
* Summary_formulation_demo_2.ipynb – slightly modified approach
* Outlier_detector_demo.ipynb – detection of comments with number assesment that does not correspond to author assesment
* Feature_extraction_demo.ipynb – testing the abilities of LLMs in analysis of the text
